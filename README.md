# Python syntax highlighting for VSCode.

The two included files:
- MagicPython.tmLanguage.json
- MagicRegExp.tmLanguage.json

are the cson python syntax files from [Atom Python Syntax](https://github.com/atom/language-python) converted to json and renamed to the VSCode python syntax files.

## Use:

replace the two files in the following VSCode path ``VSCode\resources\app\extensions\python\syntaxes`` with the ones in this repo


**Note:** Seems like it is not functioning anymore, needs to be looked into.
